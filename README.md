# Full-Stack Application: Resume Maker

This is a Full-Stack application that combines a React frontend with a Spring Boot backend. The project's primary purpose is to serve as a resume maker, allowing users to create their own resumes using templates tailored to their specific fields, such as doctors or engineers.

## Features
